[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m building Quanta, a clinical laboratory ERP, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to document the entire journey publicly.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t because I think my specific project is uniquely interesting—though I hope it will be useful—but because building in public has become one of the most powerful ways to create something people actually want while building genuine connections with the community you\u0026rsquo;re trying to serve.\nWhy Build in Public? The traditional approach to building software, especially for specialized markets like clinical laboratories, is to work in stealth mode for months or years, perfect your product in isolation, then launch with a big reveal. This approach has obvious appeal: you control the narrative, avoid premature criticism, and can pivot without public scrutiny.\nBut it also has serious downsides, especially when building for a market as specialized as clinical laboratory operations. How do you know you\u0026rsquo;re building the right features if you\u0026rsquo;re not constantly validating assumptions with people who actually work in labs? How do you build trust in a conservative industry if potential users first encounter your product as a polished marketing website with no history?\nBuilding in public flips this model. Instead of hiding the process, you make it part of the value proposition. The community gets to see how decisions are made, what trade-offs are considered, and how feedback gets incorporated. In return, you get constant reality checks, early adopters who feel invested in the success of the project, and the kind of credibility that only comes from sustained, transparent effort.\nThe Clinical Lab Context This approach feels particularly important for Quanta because clinical laboratories are inherently conservative environments—and for good reason. When your work directly impacts patient diagnosis and treatment, you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to experiment with unreliable tools.\nBut this conservatism also means that lab professionals have been burned by vendors who promised to understand their workflows but clearly didn\u0026rsquo;t. They\u0026rsquo;re rightly skeptical of new solutions, especially from small companies or individual developers.\nBuilding in public helps address this skepticism by providing transparency into both the technical development process and the domain expertise behind it. When I write about specific laboratory challenges, lab professionals can evaluate whether I actually understand their world. When I make technical decisions about database design or API architecture, developers can assess the quality of the implementation.\nThis transparency builds trust gradually, which is exactly how trust should be built in healthcare-adjacent markets.\nWhat \u0026ldquo;Building in Public\u0026rdquo; Looks Like For Quanta, building in public means several things:\nRegular Updates: Not just major milestones, but the day-to-day progress, challenges, and decisions. What features are getting prioritized and why? What technical problems are proving harder than expected? How are conversations with potential users influencing the roadmap?\nOpen Source Core: The fundamental laboratory operations modules will always be open source. Anyone can examine the code, contribute improvements, or fork the project if they disagree with the direction.\nPublic Roadmap: Development priorities will be visible and influenced by community feedback. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean building by committee, but it does mean explaining decisions and being responsive to input from people who actually work in labs.\nHonest Assessment: Both successes and failures get documented. When features don\u0026rsquo;t work as planned, when user feedback reveals fundamental misunderstandings, when technical debt starts causing problems—all of this gets shared honestly.\nCommunity Involvement: As the user base grows, involving lab professionals in feature design, beta testing, and roadmap planning. The goal is to build a product that feels like it was created by the community, not imposed on it.\nCurrent State: Just Getting Started Right now, Quanta exists primarily as an idea, some early architectural decisions, and this website. The Frappe framework has been chosen as the foundation because of its strength in building business applications with complex workflows, but actual development is just beginning.\nThe immediate priorities are:\nCore Infrastructure: Setting up the basic Frappe application structure, database design, and development environment Inventory Management: The first major module, focusing on reagent tracking, expiration monitoring, and automated reorder points Quality Control Framework: Basic QC tracking and trending capabilities User Interface Design: Making sure the interface feels natural to laboratory professionals, not generic business software Each of these will be developed incrementally, with regular updates on progress, challenges, and decisions.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Different This Time Building enterprise software in public isn\u0026rsquo;t new, but it\u0026rsquo;s still relatively uncommon in specialized markets like clinical laboratories. Most lab software is built by large, established companies with significant R\u0026amp;D budgets and years-long development cycles.\nQuanta takes a different approach: start with deep domain expertise, build the minimum viable product quickly, and iterate rapidly based on real user feedback. The open source model reduces barriers to adoption while the public development process builds trust and community involvement.\nThe bet is that this approach can produce better software faster than traditional closed development, especially in markets where user feedback is critical and trust is earned slowly.\nGetting Involved If you work in clinical laboratory operations and this approach interests you, there are several ways to get involved:\nShare Your Challenges: What problems do you face with current lab software? What features would make your daily work easier? Follow the Journey: Subscribe to updates to see how development progresses and provide feedback on decisions Technical Contributions: As the codebase develops, contributions from developers with laboratory or healthcare experience will be especially valuable Beta Testing: When early versions become available, hands-on testing from lab professionals will be crucial Building in public only works if there\u0026rsquo;s actually a public interested in being involved. The laboratory community\u0026rsquo;s feedback, criticism, and encouragement will ultimately determine whether Quanta becomes something useful or just another abandoned project.\nNext Steps The next major update will focus on the technical foundation: framework setup, database design decisions, and the first working prototype of inventory management. This will probably reveal all sorts of assumptions that need revisiting and problems that weren\u0026rsquo;t apparent in the planning phase.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly why building in public makes sense. Better to discover and fix these issues early, with community input, than to perfect them in isolation only to find they don\u0026rsquo;t solve real problems.\nThe goal is to move from \u0026ldquo;interesting idea\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;useful software\u0026rdquo; as quickly as possible, with transparency and community involvement at every step.\nWant to follow Quanta\u0026rsquo;s development?

They\u0026rsquo;re navigating through nested menu systems that require memorizing obscure keyboard shortcuts, manually transcribing data between systems that should communicate seamlessly, and spending significant portions of their day fighting with software instead of focusing on patient care.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just an aesthetic problem or a minor inconvenience. When laboratory software is poorly designed, it directly impacts both operational efficiency and patient outcomes. Yet the clinical laboratory software market has remained remarkably resistant to modernization, leaving labs trapped with systems that create more problems than they solve.\nThe User Experience Problem The most immediately obvious issue is user experience. Most laboratory information systems (LIMS) feel like they were designed by database administrators for database administrators, not by people who understand laboratory workflows.\nConsider a common scenario: a clinical microbiologist needs to review yesterday\u0026rsquo;s positive blood cultures and check whether follow-up testing has been completed. In a well-designed system, this should take seconds. In reality, it often requires:\nLogging into the primary LIMS Navigating to the specimen search module Entering complex query parameters Scrolling through cryptic result codes Cross-referencing with the QC module to check test validity Switching to a separate inventory system to verify reagent status Maybe even checking a third system for instrument maintenance logs Each step introduces opportunities for error, and the cognitive overhead of managing multiple systems and interfaces reduces the mental energy available for the complex clinical decision-making that actually requires human expertise.\nData Silos and Integration Nightmares Laboratory operations involve dozens of interconnected systems: the main LIMS, inventory management, quality control tracking, instrument interfaces, billing systems, and regulatory reporting platforms. In an ideal world, these would work together seamlessly, with data flowing automatically between systems and presenting a unified view of laboratory operations.\nInstead, most labs deal with a patchwork of systems that barely communicate with each other. Want to understand whether last month\u0026rsquo;s reagent quality issues correlate with QC failures? You\u0026rsquo;ll need to export data from three different systems, manually align timestamps, and build your own analysis in Excel.\nThis fragmentation doesn\u0026rsquo;t just waste time—it obscures important patterns that could improve both laboratory operations and patient care. When data is trapped in silos, it becomes nearly impossible to identify trends, optimize workflows, or make data-driven improvements.\nThe Compliance Burden Clinical laboratories operate in a heavily regulated environment, with requirements from CLIA, CAP, FDA, and various state agencies. Compliance is critical for maintaining accreditation and ensuring patient safety, but current software often makes compliance harder, not easier.\nInstead of automatically tracking required quality control procedures and flagging potential issues before they become problems, most systems require manual documentation and retrospective analysis. Quality managers spend enormous amounts of time generating reports for inspections, often manually aggregating data that should be automatically available.\nThe irony is that laboratories generate massive amounts of data that could make compliance both easier and more meaningful. Every test performed, every quality control check, every reagent lot—it\u0026rsquo;s all tracked. But the data exists in formats and systems that make analysis difficult, turning compliance from an opportunity for continuous improvement into a periodic scramble to satisfy auditors.\nInnovation Stagnation Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the current state is how little innovation occurs in laboratory software. The major vendors have captured markets through long-term contracts and integration complexity, creating high switching costs that reduce competitive pressure.\nThis market dynamic means that software features lag years or decades behind what\u0026rsquo;s possible with modern technology. While consumer applications routinely incorporate machine learning, real-time collaboration, and intuitive interfaces, laboratory software remains focused on basic data entry and retrieval.\nThe result is that laboratories—which are fundamentally data-driven organizations—have limited ability to leverage their data for operational improvements or clinical insights. AMR surveillance that could inform clinical practice remains a manual, periodic process. Inventory optimization relies on historical averages instead of predictive modeling. Quality control analysis focuses on basic trending instead of sophisticated pattern recognition that could identify problems early.\nThe Cost of Poor Software These problems aren\u0026rsquo;t just inconvenient—they have real costs for laboratories, healthcare systems, and patients:\nOperational Inefficiency: Staff spend excessive time on administrative tasks that should be automated, reducing the time available for clinical activities that require human expertise.\nError Rates: Complex, unintuitive interfaces increase the likelihood of data entry errors and make it harder to catch mistakes before they affect patient care.\nStaff Satisfaction: Talented laboratory professionals become frustrated with tools that make their jobs harder, contributing to turnover and recruitment challenges.\nMissed Opportunities: Data that could drive operational improvements and clinical insights remains underutilized because systems make analysis difficult.\nCompliance Risk: Manual processes and poor data integration create gaps that could result in regulatory violations.\nWhat Labs Actually Need The solution isn\u0026rsquo;t to add more features to existing systems—it\u0026rsquo;s to fundamentally rethink how laboratory software should work. Labs need:\nUnified Data Model: All laboratory operations—samples, results, inventory, QC, maintenance—should be part of a single, integrated system that makes connections and patterns visible.\nIntelligent Automation: Routine tasks like QC trending, inventory reordering, and compliance documentation should happen automatically, freeing staff to focus on exceptions and clinical decision-making.\nModern Interface Design: Laboratory software should feel as intuitive and responsive as the consumer applications that staff use daily.\nBuilt-in Analytics: Instead of requiring manual data export and analysis, systems should provide real-time insights into laboratory operations, quality trends, and performance metrics.\nFlexible Reporting: Generating reports for inspections, management, or clinical staff should be straightforward, with customizable templates and automatic data aggregation.\nAPI-First Architecture: Labs should be able to easily integrate new tools, instruments, and services without vendor lock-in or complex custom development.\nThe Path Forward The good news is that the technology to build better laboratory software exists today. Modern web frameworks, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning platforms provide all the tools needed to create systems that are both powerful and user-friendly.\nThe challenge is market dynamics. Building software for clinical laboratories requires deep domain expertise, significant regulatory knowledge, and the patience to navigate complex sales cycles. It\u0026rsquo;s easier for vendors to maintain existing systems than to rebuild them from scratch.\nBut the opportunity is significant. Laboratories that can access modern, well-designed software will gain substantial advantages in efficiency, compliance, and data utilization. As healthcare systems face increasing pressure to improve outcomes while controlling costs, the labs with the best operational tools will be best positioned to contribute to these goals.\nThis is why projects like Quanta matter. By building modern laboratory software with actual laboratory professionals involved in every design decision, we can demonstrate what becomes possible when software truly serves the needs of its users.\nClinical laboratories deserve software that enhances their capabilities rather than hindering them. The technology exists to build it—now it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of making it happen.\nHave experience with laboratory software that either exemplifies these problems or provides a better model?

Need to track reagent expiry dates across multiple batches? That\u0026rsquo;ll be seventeen clicks and three different screens. Want to generate a QC report that actually makes sense to auditors? Hope you enjoy manually exporting data and rebuilding it in Excel.\nThe problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that laboratory information systems don\u0026rsquo;t exist—there are plenty of them. The problem is that most were designed by people who have never pipetted a sample, never had to explain a critical result to a panicked physician at 2 AM, and certainly never tried to maintain regulatory compliance while managing inventory, staff schedules, and instrument maintenance all at once.\nThe Gap Between Software and Reality Working in clinical microbiology taught me something that no amount of software development experience could: there\u0026rsquo;s a massive gap between what vendors think labs need and what labs actually need.\nVendors focus on the big, obvious requirements—sample tracking, result reporting, regulatory compliance. These are important, but they\u0026rsquo;re just the tip of the iceberg. What about the lab tech who needs to quickly check if yesterday\u0026rsquo;s positive blood culture follow-up was processed? Or the supervisor trying to understand why the monthly reagent budget keeps getting blown? Or the quality manager preparing for an inspection who needs to demonstrate six months of QC trends in a format that actually tells a story?\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t edge cases—they\u0026rsquo;re daily realities. But when you\u0026rsquo;re building software from the outside looking in, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to miss them.\nWhy Bioinformatics + Lab Ops = Opportunity My background spans both worlds. I\u0026rsquo;ve managed lab operations, dealt with the compliance headaches, and debugged why the morning shift\u0026rsquo;s controls failed. I\u0026rsquo;ve also built machine learning models, analyzed genomic data, and written software that processes thousands of clinical samples.\nThis combination revealed something interesting: clinical labs are sitting on goldmines of data that could revolutionize both operations and patient care, but they\u0026rsquo;re trapped by systems that treat data as an afterthought.\nConsider antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Most labs dutifully report AMR data to public health agencies, but they can\u0026rsquo;t easily analyze their own trends, benchmark against peers, or identify emerging resistance patterns that might inform clinical practice. The data exists—it\u0026rsquo;s just locked away in systems that make analysis painful.\nOr take inventory management. Every lab tracks reagent usage, but how many can predict when they\u0026rsquo;ll run out of critical supplies based on seasonal testing patterns, or automatically identify lot-to-lot performance variations that might affect quality control?\nBuilding Quanta: Software by Lab People, for Lab People Quanta is my attempt to bridge this gap. It\u0026rsquo;s a clinical laboratory ERP built on the robust Frappe framework, but designed with the daily realities of lab operations at its core.\nThe key insight is that clinical labs need more than just a LIMS—they need comprehensive operational management that understands the unique workflows, regulatory requirements, and data opportunities that exist in laboratory settings.\nSome examples of what this means in practice:\nInventory Management: Not just tracking what you have, but predicting what you\u0026rsquo;ll need based on testing patterns, automatically flagging potential stockouts, and identifying cost optimization opportunities without compromising quality.\nQuality Control: Moving beyond simple pass/fail tracking to trend analysis, automatic identification of concerning patterns, and integration with inventory to track reagent performance across lots and suppliers.\nAMR Surveillance: Built-in analysis tools that make it easy for labs to understand their own resistance patterns, benchmark performance, and contribute to broader surveillance efforts without additional overhead.\nWorkflow Optimization: Learning from actual lab operations to suggest improvements, identify bottlenecks, and help staff focus on high-value activities instead of administrative overhead.\nOpen Source Core, Premium Intelligence Quanta follows an open source core with premium features model. The fundamental laboratory operations modules—inventory, QC, sample tracking, basic reporting—are open source and always will be.\nThe premium features focus on intelligence: machine learning-powered AMR surveillance, predictive analytics for inventory optimization, advanced trend analysis, and custom integrations. These features require ongoing development and support, but they build on the open foundation.\nThis approach ensures accessibility while creating a sustainable development model. Small labs get excellent basic functionality for free, while larger organizations and those wanting advanced analytics can access premium features through subscription.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next I\u0026rsquo;m building Quanta publicly, sharing both the successes and the inevitable challenges along the way. The first priority is getting the core laboratory operations modules working reliably—inventory management, quality control tracking, and basic reporting.\nOnce the foundation is solid, the plan is to gradually add the intelligence features that make Quanta unique: ML-powered AMR analysis, predictive inventory optimization, and the kind of operational insights that are only possible when software truly understands laboratory workflows.\nThe goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just to build better lab software—it\u0026rsquo;s to unlock the potential that exists in every clinical laboratory to improve both their own operations and patient care more broadly.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re working in clinical laboratory operations, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear about your experiences with existing systems and what you wish was different. Building in public means building with the community, and your insights will help shape what Quanta becomes.\nInterested in following Quanta\u0026rsquo;s development?
