## Quanta: Clinical Laboratory ERP

**Status**: Early development  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Frappe Framework, MariaDB, FastAPI

Quanta is a specialized ERP system designed specifically for clinical laboratories. Unlike generic laboratory information systems, Quanta is built by someone who has actually worked in labs and understands the unique operational challenges they face.

### Key Features

- **Reagent and Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking with automated reorder points and expiration monitoring
- **Quality Control Tracking**: Comprehensive QC management with automated compliance reporting
- **ML-powered AMR Surveillance**: Premium feature providing antimicrobial resistance monitoring and trend analysis
- **Instrument Integration**: Seamless data flow from laboratory analyzers to reporting systems
- **Workflow Optimization**: Laboratory operations designed by lab professionals for lab professionals

### Business Model

Quanta follows an open source core with SaaS premium features approach:
- Core laboratory operations modules are open source
- Advanced features like ML-powered AMR surveillance available via subscription
- Custom integrations and enterprise support available

### Links
- GitHub: *Coming soon*
- Documentation: *Coming soon*
- Demo: *Coming soon*

## Academic Publications

**Focus**: Methodology papers published annually to maintain academic credibility while building Quanta

### Published Work

- **MSc Thesis**: "Interpretable Machine Learning for Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction in Klebsiella pneumoniae"
  - Research focused on developing explainable AI models for clinical AMR prediction
  - Bridged the gap between machine learning accuracy and clinical interpretability

### Future Publications

I maintain an active research profile with approximately one methodology paper per year, focusing on:
- Laboratory informatics methodologies
- Machine learning applications in clinical microbiology
- Open source tools for laboratory operations

## Open Source Contributions

**Status**: Planned contributions as Quanta development progresses

### Focus Areas

- **Frappe Framework Ecosystem**: Contributing back to the platform that powers Quanta
- **Laboratory Informatics Tools**: Open source utilities for clinical lab operations
- **Bioinformatics Workflows**: Standardized pipelines for clinical data analysis

### Philosophy

Building in public and contributing to the open source ecosystem that makes projects like Quanta possible. All core Quanta modules will be open source to ensure accessibility and community-driven improvement.
