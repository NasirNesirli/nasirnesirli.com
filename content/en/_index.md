**Computational Microbiology & Bioinformatics Engineering**

I work at the intersection of clinical microbiology, genomics, and machine learning, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and pathogen genomics.

My background spans:
- 10+ years building and leading clinical microbiology & diagnostic labs
- Master's in Bioinformatics from the University of Birmingham  
- Hands-on experience with NGS analysis, AMR gene detection, and ML-based prediction models

I build advanced genomic data science tools and AI-driven AMR prediction models, creating pipelines that connect real-world microbiology with modern computational methods.
