title: "Computational Microbiologist & Genomics Expert"
description: "Learn about my background in computational microbiology, 10+ years clinical experience, Birmingham University bioinformatics degree, and current AMR genomics research and ML model development."

I am a clinical microbiologist and bioinformatics engineer focused on genomics, antimicrobial resistance, and machine learning.

For more than a decade, I worked in clinical laboratory leadership - designing diagnostic laboratories, implementing quality systems, training teams, and improving microbiology workflows at scale. This experience gave me a deep understanding of pathogens, AMR mechanisms, and the realities of diagnostic data.

After completing my Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, I focused on computational microbiology, where I combine my clinical background with software, genomics, and ML engineering.

## Currently

**Oct 2025 - Present | Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Project & Computational Research**  
*Baku, Azerbaijan*

Simultaneously leading multi-site clinical microbiology laboratory setup (laboratory design, BioMérieux instrumentation, staff training) and developing computational microbiology tools. This dual role allows me to bridge practical laboratory challenges with AI/ML solutions. I also teach courses on laboratory science and bioinformatics through [courses.nasirnesirli.com](https://courses.nasirnesirli.com).

## My current interests include:

- AMR gene prediction using transformer models (DNABERT2, ESM2)
- End-to-end genomic pipelines (Nextflow, Docker, nf-core)
- Sequencing-based clinical diagnostics
- Pathogen classification from raw reads
- Machine learning for genomic epidemiology

I aim to build tools that make microbial genomics faster, more accurate, and globally scalable.
