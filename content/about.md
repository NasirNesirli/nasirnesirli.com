## Who I Am

I'm a laboratory operations expert with an MSc in Bioinformatics, where my thesis focused on interpretable machine learning for antimicrobial resistance prediction in Klebsiella pneumoniae. I also hold a BSc in Microbiology and have extensive experience as a clinical laboratory manager.

Currently, I'm leading a microbiology laboratory setup project in Azerbaijan in partnership with BioMérieux, bringing modern laboratory operations and instrumentation to clinical settings where they can make the biggest impact.

In addition to my laboratory and development work, I'm passionate about education and teach courses on clinical laboratory operations, bioinformatics, and the intersection of technology and healthcare through [courses.nasirnesirli.com](https://courses.nasirnesirli.com).

## What I'm Building

**Quanta** is a specialized ERP system built specifically for clinical laboratories, developed on the robust Frappe/ERPNext framework. Unlike generic laboratory information systems, Quanta is designed by someone who has actually worked in labs and understands the unique operational challenges they face.

Key features include:
- Comprehensive reagent and inventory management
- Quality control tracking and compliance automation
- ML-powered antimicrobial resistance surveillance as a premium feature
- Seamless instrument integration with laboratory analyzers
- Workflow optimization based on real-world lab operations

Quanta follows an open source core with a SaaS business model, ensuring accessibility while supporting sustainable development and ongoing innovation.

## Expertise

My unique combination of hands-on laboratory experience and bioinformatics expertise allows me to bridge the gap between operational needs and technological solutions:

- **Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Operations**: Years of experience managing lab workflows, compliance, and staff
- **Laboratory Information Systems**: Deep understanding of what labs actually need vs. what vendors think they need
- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance**: Combining clinical data with ML to improve AMR monitoring and reporting
- **Bioinformatics & Machine Learning**: Practical application of ML techniques to laboratory data and surveillance
- **Laboratory Instrumentation**: Hands-on experience with BioMérieux systems and other clinical analyzers

## Why This Matters

Clinical laboratories are the backbone of modern healthcare, processing millions of tests that inform critical medical decisions. Yet most labs are still using software designed in the 1990s, with interfaces that feel like they haven't been updated since Windows 95.

The problem isn't just poor user experience—it's operational inefficiency, compliance headaches, and missed opportunities for data-driven insights that could improve patient care. Labs need software built by people who understand laboratory operations, not generic enterprise software adapted for lab use.

My vision is to combine deep laboratory operations expertise with modern bioinformatics and machine learning capabilities. This unique combination allows Quanta to not just manage lab operations more efficiently, but also unlock new capabilities for antimicrobial resistance surveillance and clinical decision support.

The goal is simple: help laboratories operate more efficiently while advancing our collective ability to combat antimicrobial resistance and improve patient outcomes.
